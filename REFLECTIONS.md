## What I Learned

### Open-Source Workflow
By structuring the repository with `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, and `ROADMAP.md`, I learned how to make a project welcoming and navigable for external contributors. Open-source isnâ€™t just about code â€” it's about clear communication, documentation, and onboarding.

### Branch Protection & CI/CD
Setting up branch protection and CI/CD workflows taught me how automated checks and peer reviews protect software from regression. I now better appreciate tools like GitHub Actions and their role in enforcing quality in real-world development.

### Issue Management
Creating and tagging issues gave me insight into prioritizing tasks, defining scope, and breaking down complex goals into beginner-friendly contributions. Labeling `good-first-issue` made me consider how someone unfamiliar with the project would approach it.

## Challenges Faced

### Choosing Granularity
One challenge was determining the right level of detail in onboarding docs â€” too vague and it confuses new contributors, too dense and it becomes overwhelming.

### ðŸ§ª Consistency in Tests
Another difficulty was aligning automated tests across modules. Ensuring each service and API route was tested under the same CI workflow required attention to detail and consistency.

### Peer Collaboration
Sharing the repo and asking for feedback (e.g., forks/stars) felt like pitching a real-world project. It challenged me to think about presentation, maintainability, and how to respond to suggestions.

## Broader Takeaways

- **Open-source is a team sport**: Great documentation and clear PR workflows make a project easier to maintain and scale.
- **Automation is key**: Tests and checks reduce human error and increase trust.
- **Communication matters**: Labels, issue descriptions, and commit messages shape how a project is perceived by contributors.
